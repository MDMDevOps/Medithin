#Project Overview

"Simple" retrofit of [medithinweightlossclinics.com](http://www.medithinweightlossclinics.com/) to be responsive. Bootstrap version 2.x.x is already included in the stylesheet, so as much as we can reuse as possible.

This is a rendered copy of their website, so it wont be exact. The actual files that will need to be be released to the client will be located under the /dist/ directory. They are PHP files, but we will also include some styles as well, to retrofit non-bootstrap classes.
